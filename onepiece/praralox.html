        <h1>Adventure Time</h1>
        <p class="text1">
          Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most
          infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and
          execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout
          the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of
          the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation
          that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of
          finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and
          fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the
          Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your
          standard definition of a pirate. <br /><br />
          Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless
          pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate
          is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads
          him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure.
          Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew
          travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling
          dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the
          most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.
